Hello, this is a _paragraph_! I hope it looks good with your styling, Sean!
**Blah blah blah!** Wow! _**Lorem ipsum something something something.**_ Haha,
I know latin! ~~Well, not really...~~ Okay, maybe this is long enough now.

Here's some HTML:

As a wise Sean once said:

And here's some inline C: `printf("%s", "Hello, World!");`.

And a fenced code block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}
```

Did you know `std::cout` can be used to print to the standard output stream?

Here's a horizontal rule:

And a table:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header3                  | HELLO  | HIIIIIIIIIIIIII |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Hi       | Hello    | LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG BOI | HI     | HI THERE!!      |
| Sup      | Wow!     | LOLOL                    | HIIIII | HEJ             |

Hey, and what about a list of tasks:
- [x] Did this
- [x] and that
- [ ] but not this :(

Hey, how about a footnote[^1], and a longer one[^longnote].

[^1]: First footnote.
[^longnote]: 2nd, longer footnote.

    This paragraph is included in the footnote!

    `code too`

    And **another**!
