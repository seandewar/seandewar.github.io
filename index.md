## Welcome to my site!

![Me looking fly](/img/me-circle-border.png)

I am a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with UK first-class honours who has
enjoyed programming as a hobby since childhood. I have always been interested
by the ability programming has to turn ideas into something substantial; I
often describe it as the closest thing we will ever have to magic!

I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic at the age of eight.
Since then, I have dabbled in languages such as C#, Visual Basic, Java, Rust,
Python, Lua, Haskell, and others, but my preferred tools of the trade are C++
and C.

This site is currently **under construction**, but I hope to list information
regarding [some of my projects over the years](https://bit.ly/2nRm6KL) (and
other things!)

If you have the time, be sure to check out my
[GitHub](https://github.com/seandewar)! ;)
