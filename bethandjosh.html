                    Congratulations — you've won! You managed to snag yourself
                    (and maybe a couple of loved ones) a ticket to the hottest
                    event of the year. Together, you and some other randomly
                    selected individuals can awkwardly participate in the forced
                    social event surrounding Bethany Auld and Joshua Berry
                    signing a piece of paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who are they, you will probably ask? Oh... you don't care?
                    Over a year of lockdowns and social isolations means that
                    you'll now attend the event without any further
                    information... Well, I had a whole speech prepared so I'm
                    going to tell you anyway:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Josh and Beth met at college one lunch break. They met a few
                    times,  but when Josh actually took the time to shut up for
                    a minute, the two were able to get to know each other. If
                    you've ever spent a long time with Josh, you'll see he can
                    be a loudmouth and want the attention!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite this, Beth decided that she could tolerate him and
                    got to know him. A few weeks later, on the 30th November
                    2013, they started dating. Josh instantly fell head over
                    heels for this perfect specimen, and Beth decided she would
                    be going to university soon and could just leave him behind.
                    Josh saw through her plan and spent a year wearing her down.
                    He then bought a car and learned to drive so that she
                    wouldn't have to leave him behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For her three undergraduate years, regardless of awful work
                    shifts or Beth's university workload, he made sure to turn
                    up and be there. He would join in with the university social
                    nights and get to know her flatmates. He made friends with
                    her flatmates, bonding over a shared love of Wagamama's,
                    Carluccio's and chocolate hobnobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After almost 5 years together, the couple had flourished
                    into independent adults together. They had gone from living
                    at home to living self-reliant, adult lives. Josh learned
                    how to cook, clean, and fend for himself. Beth already knew
                    all that, so she just filled her brain with science. Yet,
                    despite the literal distance between them, they spent so
                    much time talking, sharing new experiences and growing
                    together, that they couldn't imagine life apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was then that, Beth was offered her dream PhD position,
                    on the other side of the country. Josh had a good job and a
                    life in Nuneaton, but he didn't hesitate to leave it behind
                    and follow her. He could get another job, but he couldn't
                    get another Beth. And it was <em>very</em> unlikely that
                    Beth would find another dream PhD position!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, they moved to Brighton, took Ozzy (the awful dog) from
                    Beth's parents, and began their next chapter. They
                    coexisted well, exceeding even Josh's romanticized
                    expectations! So, on the 30th November 2018, exactly 5 years
                    after they began dating, Beth graciously accepted the
                    beautiful, shiny ring (and Josh's proposal).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The years following were difficult; struggles with the cost
                    of living in the south, Beth's PhD, Josh's jobs, family
                    health issues, and a move to Horsham — and that's all
                    discounting COVID! But, no matter what life threw at them,
                    they held each other up and battled through it together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, On the 30th November 2021, you are invited to
                    celebrate exactly 8 years of awful life decisions with them,
                    and toast to a future of even worse decisions, always made
                    together.
                </p>

                    As stated in the introduction, this is going to be the
                    hottest event of the year, and so you better be dressed so
                    cool that the cool kids are jealous. Most importantly, make
                    sure you wear something you like and are comfortable in.

                    If you are lucky enough to be invited for the whole day
                    (there are very limited numbers for the ceremony), you
                    should probably wear something smart during the ceremony, or
                    you will stand out like a sore thumb and draw attention away
                    from the "happy" couple.

                    There's going to be a photographer specifically looking for
                    the <em>"coolest of the cool, bruh"</em>, but he'll also be
                    on the hunt for the <em>"did you even read the dress
                    code?"</em> guy.

                    If you're just turning up for the party, good choice! Take
                    it down a notch, wear smart casual. Let me see those shirts
                    with your jeans. Let me see your top hat and summer shorts
                    in the middle of November. Mostly anything goes here, except
                    jogging bottoms. No jogging bottoms please! You are supposed
                    to be comfortable, but not that comfortable, y'know!

                    Firstly, although most people use their weddings to leech
                    every penny from the family and friends that they rarely
                    see, it should be made very clear that this couple are not
                    expecting gifts from anyone! If they had to choose between
                    wedding gifts and you attending their special day, they
                    would (rather surprisingly) have you attend!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for those of you who wish to splash some cash,
                    there are multiple options for you:

                        A night of free drinks sounds good for anybody, but it
                        sounds especially good for those who have dieted solidly
                        for the last 6 months, so that they can fit into a
                        wedding dress!

                        Putting money behind the bar can make sure everybody can
                        have a good time, and not have to constantly reach for
                        their wallet or purse.

                            holiday abroad? That's because neither of them have
                            had a proper holiday since many years before they
                            met!)
