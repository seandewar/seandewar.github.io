    <p class="bio-text">I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with UK
        first-class honours who has enjoyed programming as a hobby since
        childhood. I've always been interested by the ability programming has
        to turn ideas into something substantial; I often describe it as the
        closest thing we will ever have to magic!</p>
    <p class="bio-text">I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic
        when I was 8 years old.  Since then, I've dabbled in languages such as
        C#, Visual Basic, Java, Rust, Python, Lua, Haskell, &amp; others, but
        my preferred tools of the trade are C++ &amp; C.</p>

                    Color emulator featuring video &amp; sound emulation,
                    debugging tools, and some features not available on the
                    real hardware (such as on-demand pausing and
                    fast-forwarding of the emulation).  <br/><br/> It includes
                    support for emulating most major cartridge hardware
                    configurations and the ability to import and export save
                    files (automatically and manually).  <br/><br/> Won the
                    2018 best final year B.Sc./M.Comp. Computer Science project
                    prize at the University of Leicester.</p>
