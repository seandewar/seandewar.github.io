    <p class="bio">I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with UK first-class
        honours who has enjoyed programming as a hobby since childhood. I've
        always been interested by the ability programming has to turn ideas
        into something substantial; I often describe it as the closest thing we
        will ever have to magic!</p>

    <p class="bio">I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic at the
        age of eight.  Since then, I've dabbled in languages such as C#, Visual
        Basic, Java, Rust, Python, Lua, Haskell, and others, but my preferred
    tools of the trade are C++ and C.</p>
