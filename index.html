                    I'm a British B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with 1st-class
                    honours who has enjoyed programming since childhood. I've
                    always been interested by the ability programming has to
                    turn ideas into something substantial; I often describe it
                    as the closest thing we will ever have to magic!

                    I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic when I
                    was 8 years old. Since then, I've dabbled in languages such
                    as C, C#, Java, Rust, Python, Lua, and others, but my
                    preferred tool of the trade is C++.
