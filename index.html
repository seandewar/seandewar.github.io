            I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with UK 1st-class honours who
            has enjoyed programming since childhood. I've always been
            interested by the ability programming has to turn ideas into
            something substantial; I often describe it as the closest thing we
            will ever have to magic!
        </p>

            I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic when I was 8
            years old.  Since then, I've dabbled in languages such as C#,
            Visual Basic, Java, Rust, Python, Lua, Haskell and others, but my
            preferred tools of the trade are C++ and C.
