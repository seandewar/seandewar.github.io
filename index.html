<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<img class="center" src="/img/me-circle-border.png" alt="Me looking fly">

<p>I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with UK first-class honours who has
    enjoyed programming as a hobby since childhood. I've always been interested
    by the ability programming has to turn ideas into something substantial; I
often describe it as the closest thing we will ever have to magic!</p>

<p>I began my programming journey tinkering with QBasic at the age of eight.
    Since then, I've dabbled in languages such as C#, Visual Basic, Java,
    Rust, Python, Lua, Haskell, and others, but my preferred tools of the trade
are C++ and C.</p>

<p>This site is currently <em>under construction</em>, but I hope to list
information regarding <a href="https://bit.ly/2nRm6KL">some of my projects over the years</a>
(and other things!)</p>
